              Elon Musk takes control of Twitter in $44bn deal

              Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share in a filing
              published Thursday, saying the social media company needs to be
              transformed privately, a little over a week after revealing a 9.1%
              stake in the company. Musk's offer values Twitter at about $43
              billion. "I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to
              be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe
              free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"
              Musk wrote in a letter sent to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor and
              disclosed in a securities filing. Twitter shares closed down 1.68%
              on Thursday. Tesla's stock dipped more than 3.6% on the news.
              According to Musk, the social media company needs to go private
              because it can "neither thrive nor serve" free speech in its
              current state.

              General elections were held in India in nine phases from 7 April
              to 12 May 2014 to elect the members of the 16th Lok Sabha. With
              834 million registered voters, they were the largest-ever
              elections in the world until being surpassed by the 2019
              elections. Around 23.1 million or 2.7% of the total eligible
              voters were aged 18â€“19 years. A total of 8,251 candidates
              contested the 543 elected Lok Sabha seats. The average election
              turnout over all nine phases was around 66.40%, the highest ever
              in the history of Indian general elections. The results were
              declared on 16 May, 15 days before the 15th Lok Sabha completed
              its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014. The counting
              exercise was held at 989 counting centres. The Bharatiya Janata
              Party (BJP) received 31% of the vote and won 282 seats, while its
              National Democratic Alliance won a total of 336 seats. The BJP's
              vote share was the lowest by a party winning a majority of seats
              since independence, However, the governing coalition had the
              largest majority since the 1984 elections, and it was the first
              time since 1984 that a party had won enough seats to govern
              without the support of other parties.
